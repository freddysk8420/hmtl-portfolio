<h1>The best movies according to Freddy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Flipped</h3>
<p>Flipped is such a heart-meating movie about two kids who met each other by growing up in the street, they fell in love at first sight. I highly recommend this movie if you like to watch a lovely story</p>
<h3>Upgraded</h3>
<p>Upgraded is a movie for people who's tired of having terrible bosses who like to give all the work and expect you not to ask for anything in return.</p>
<h3>Avengers</h3>
<p>Cool super heroes movie, which is worth watching.</p>
